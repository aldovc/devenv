# Docker Dev Env (WIP)
Just my own development environment with the very basics to start hacking away :D
It makes use of my own [dot files](https://github.com/aldovc/dotfiles)

# Installation
- `$ git clone https://github.com/aldovc/devenv`
- `$ cd devenv`
- `$ docker build -t aldovc/devenv .`

# Start the container
- `$ docker run -it aldovc/devenv /bin/bash`

### Note for Windows Users (Cygwin)
You need to install [wintpy](https://github.com/rprichard/winpty) in order to properly interface with Unix terminal.

# TODO
List features and packages being used
